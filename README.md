# GithubRepos

This desktop web application is designed to display the top 10 repositories of any user on Github sorted based on the number of stars.
The code is mainly AngularJS with a few libraries such as AngularJS Material, Route, Normalize.

The application can either be run on a local web server or it can be accessed for the time being through a web site that I'm hosting temporarily.

All you've to do once the site opens is, type in the user whose repositories you want to view.
The application does the rest.
